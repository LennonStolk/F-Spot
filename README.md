# F-Spot ðŸŽ¼

F-Spot is an music playlist list app that I made using **React Native**, **MySQL** and **PHP**.


## Features

- Create accounts
- Add, edit and remove playlists
- Add songs to your playlists
- Listen to songs

## Deployment
The client app can be installed on Android devices via its APK file. The back-end scripts require a PHP webserver (*such as* XAMPP) and a MySQL database that is initialized with the .sql script.
